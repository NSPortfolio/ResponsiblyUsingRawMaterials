       <p> Average product-consumers are commonly unaware of how their possessions caused environmental damage, and some respond with synopses of refining and consuming that reverberate over community but lack action. By placing policies requiring education on how raw materials are processed and executing proper practices, raw materials can be utilized while protecting community ethos.</p> 
       <p> According to the World Education Blog, the higher a person’s level of education, the more likely he will live sustainably. Adequate instruction consists of finding, transporting, refining, distributing, using, discarding, reusing, and recycling materials. The first step is finding raw materials by mining. This underdeveloped procedure is the root of disasters like the dam failures in Kolontár, Hungary, and Bento Rodriguez, Brazil. The raw materials are then transported, creating pollution and potential oil-spills. In a refinery, components are reconfigured into products, but the release of greenhouse gases and industrial waste contaminates our air and water. The distribution of finished goods requires transportation and thick packaging. Unfortunately, the packaging is often discarded, taking up 1/3 of average dumps and 40% of the plastic used, leaving marine animals vulnerable to plastic.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, materials like plastic, glass, and paper can be recycled to complete the cycle by becoming raw material. Attuned that mining is a bane to environs, old phones can be recycled for metals. Additionally, items like furniture and clothing can be reused by becoming second-hand or being exploited as insulation or other articles. Endeavors to reduce carbon footprints can undo transportation and refining downsides. After edifying the cycle and its adverse effects, following proper practices can lead to more protected habitats.
By stringing together raw material education policies with action, resources can be used for practical reasons while maintaining cultural values.</p>
